### Tech Stack ###
We employed the MEN stack - MongoDB, Express, and Node.js - for PickYourCourt's development. Here's a refined overview of our deployment process using Render.com:

## NOTE:                                                                                                             (ONLY FOR DEPLOYMENT- specifically Render.com) ##
Repository Setup: Our codebase is hosted on GitHub, facilitating seamless version control and collaborative efforts.
Build Process: We meticulously installed dependencies and compiled crucial resources using the command: yarn install && npm rebuild bcrypt --build-from-source.
Server Start: We initiated the web server using the command: node app.
Environment Variables: We configured our application and safeguarded sensitive information, such as our MongoDB connection string (MongoURL), using environment variables. Leveraging the mongodb+srv URI scheme ensured secure connections to MongoDB Atlas.
